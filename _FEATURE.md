# Missing Features FROM THE STANDARD CUSTOMER PORTAL
- usage allotment viewing for token usage allotment for messaging-inference-tokens/document-upload-tokens/adapter-training-tokens/adapter-inference-tokens
- switching tiers (token usage allotment for messaging-inference-tokens/document-upload-tokens/adapter-training-tokens/adapter-inference-tokens should rollover for the month; if paid for premium then down grades to free then unused token allotment continues; visual bar to show token allotment and usage)
- pay-per-use after allotment enable/disable button


# ULTIMATE REQUIREMENTS: 
I need a dashboard with the capabilities of the current base customer portal with the Missing Features. Features (see all invoices; change cancel subscription; update payment information; update billing information; see current subscription status; login with email verification; subscribe;)

There needs to be test and live environments for the customer portal.

This is the reference documentation for the Customer Portal:
https://docs.stripe.com/payments/advanced/build-subscriptions


----
# to be built (and verify if already created)
There needs to be rate limiting to prevent too many tokens being used per period that is set.
The manage subscription dashboard needs to show:
monthly:
    token allotment
    token usage
    document token usage
    adapter training token usage
    adapter inference token usage
current tier
switch tier
cancel subscription
enable/disable pay-per-usage tokens
manage payment information
change billing information
subscribe


I need the basic customer portal for test environment and live environments now with subscription tiers and free trial in addition to the above metering awareness and usage of this api. I will be building a customer portal to extend the capability of the current customer portal with usage-based awareness. The api needs to be functional and metered now and users need to be able to subscribe now.

# Repository of the customer portal:
/home/user/gh/anubis-project/anubis-customer-portal



# Reference Material:

## Checkout: 
https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart

## Usage Based:
https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy

## Usage based api:
https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter

## Customer Portal
https://docs.stripe.com/payments/advanced/build-subscriptions

# THE API USAGE IS IN A SEPARATE REPOSITORY: /home/user/gh/anubis-project/wt/f-metering; the following is for reference of what is metered in that repository so this portal make work in conjunction with the API.

# API USAGE REQUIREMENTS:
I need the messaging tokens metered (per-user allotment per-tier per month and per-user usage per-tier per-month and rate limited per-period (tokens/second for example in alignment with the following rate limits: https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rate-limits))

I need the document upload tokens metered (per-user allotment per-tier per month and per-user usage per-tier per-month and rate limited per-period (tokens/second for example in alignment with the following rate limits: https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rate-limits))

I need the adapter training tokens metered (per-user allotment per-tier per month and per-user usage per-tier per-month and rate limited per-period (tokens/second for example in alignment with the following rate limits: https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rate-limits))

I need adapter inference tokens metered (per-user allotment per-tier per month and per-user usage per-tier per-month and rate limited per-period (tokens/second for example in alignment with the following rate limits: https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rate-limits))

This usage needs to be reported with every /message endpoint call (for messaging tokens/adapter inference)
This usage needs to be reported with every adapter training job (to be created)
This usage needs to be reported with every update_avatar_identity_with_media call (for adapter training tokens only)

There needs to be a subscribe api endpoint call
there needs to be a cancel subscription api endpoint call
there needs to be a modify subscription api endpoint call (enable/disable pay-per-usage is a parameter)
there needs to be a verify subscription api endpoint call (also shows all token allotment and current usage to date for the period)

The period is an environment variable to be set for token allotment and usage
The there are rate limit environment variables to be set for messaging requests and update_avatar_identity_with_media requests

## Rate limits need to be in alignment with the following rate limits:
https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/rate-limits


# Bottom Line
I need all metering now with api endpoints to show usage vs allotment in an api request. There needs to be limitation if pay-per-use is disabled and usage moves beyond allotment for each of the limits.

There are three tiers free, pro, premium and a free-trial with pro. 


# testing
I need to test:
sign up
cancel subscription
manage subscription endpoint
verify subscription status
change subscription status

using the /message endpoints should test 72 tokens for each scenario

using the /update_avatar_identity_with_media endpoint and the following test (text) files /home/user/gh/anubis-project/wt/f-metering/data/shivon_zilis/test_tokens_1_tokens.md
/home/user/gh/anubis-project/wt/f-metering/data/shivon_zilis/test_tokens_2_tokens.md

test audio: /home/user/gh/anubis-project/wt/f-metering/data/test_data_avatar_evan_woods/reference_audio.wav

test video: /home/user/gh/anubis-project/wt/f-metering/data/test_data_avatar_evan_woods/1minuteFounderVideo_EvanWoods_NeuralNexus.mp4

test image: /home/user/gh/anubis-project/wt/f-metering/data/test_data_avatar_evan_woods/_test_image_token_usage_54_5kb.jpg

scenarios:
I need to know the token count for the above files, test above and below metered usage allotment with both scenarios pay-per-usage enabled and disabled for all three tiers and the free trial active for pro.


# Test Situations:
Free tier:
messaging: 
 - under usage allotment messaging succeeds, metering increments
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage disabled, messaging does not succeed
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage enabled, metering increments, pay-per-usage is charged per rate for free-tier

Pro tier:
messaging: 
 - under usage allotment messaging succeeds, metering increments
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage disabled, messaging does not succeed
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage enabled, metering increments, pay-per-usage is charged per rate for pro-tier
Document token uploads:
 - under usage allotment upload succeeds, metering increments
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage disabled, document upload does not succeed
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage enabled, metering increments, pay-per-usage is charged per rate for pro-tier

 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage disabled, messaging does not succeed
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage enabled, metering increments, pay-per-usage is charged per rate for pro-tier
Document token uploads:

 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage enabled, metering increments, pay-per-usage is charged per rate for premium-tier

Adapter Training token allotment: 
 - under usage allotment adapter training succeeds, metering increments
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage disabled, adapter training does not succeed
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage enabled, metering increments, pay-per-usage is charged per rate for premium-tier

Adapter Inference:
 - under usage allotment adapter inference messaging succeeds, metering increments
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage disabled, adapter inference messaging does not succeed
 - over usage allotment, pay-per-usage enabled, metering increments, pay-per-usage is charged per rate for premium-tier


# Additional situations to test:

## Usage
Make certain usage resets at the end of the period; 
Make certain usage for messaging tokens, adapter tokens, adapter training, and document uploads from premium is retained when downgrading to free or pro tier.
Make certain usage for messaging tokens, adapter tokens, adapter training, and document uploads from premium is cleared when upgrading from free or pro tier to the next tier. (moving up to a new tier allows for the usage to be reset for the usage period) 

## Free Trial
make certain pro with free trial moves to free tier if the trial ends without payment information
make certain pro with free trial continues to pro tier if the trial ends with payment information
